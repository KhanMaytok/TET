 traveler.2.name:0 "Extragalactic Event"
 traveler.2.desc:0 "Observatories across the Galaxy have reported that a strange event has occured in intergalactic space. Gravitational waves stronger than any previously observed event were detected approximately 40,000 light years outside the galaxy. Oddly, the gravitational waves were accompanied by a burst of an unknown type of energy, far different than anything predicted by the current model of physics. Even stranger, the gravitational waves and unknown energy were detected simultaneously across the entire galaxy seemingly traveling faster than light. Scientists have refered to the event as "paracausal" as the readings seem to have ocurred outside the laws of causality."
 traveler.2.a:0 "Interesting"
 
 traveler.6.name:0 "Mysterious Object"
 traveler.6.desc:0 "Civillian ships in the [trav_system.GetName] system have reported sightings of a mysterious spherical object. Initially believed to be a rogue planetoid, further investigations have determined that the object is too smooth and uniform to be natural. It appears to move under it's own will, and as such has been nicknamed The Traveler. Our scientists have linked the object to the extragalactic event which occured a year earlier as the Traveler radiates the same energy previously detected."
 traveler.6.a:0 "Interesting. Continue observing the object."
 traveler.6.b:0 "This object must be of a divine origin."
 traveler.6.c:0 "A marvel of some distant civilization!"
 
 traveler.7.name:0 "Rumors"
 traveler.7.desc.owned:0 "Rumors of a mysterious object travelling through [trav_system_owner.GetName] space have been spreading throughout our population. These rumors describe a black sphere the size of a planetoid apparently moving under it's own will. The [trav_system_owner.GetSpeciesName] have not made a statement about the veracity of these claims."
 traveler.7.desc.unowned:0 "Rumors of a mysterious object travelling through uncolonized space near the [trav_system.GetName] have been spreading throughout our population. These rumors describe a black sphere the size of a planetoid apparently moving under it's own will. Although we have been unable to verify these claims, other empire's have reported similiar rumors in their own population."
 traveler.7.a:0 "Continue looking into these rumors."
 traveler.7.b:0 "This could be the work of the gods."
 traveler.7.c:0 "This could change everything we know."

 traveler.8.name:0 "The Traveler"
 traveler.8.desc:0 "The object previously described only in rumors has entered our borders. Our scientists have detected no radio signals emminating from it. Now known as "The Traveler," the object is under constant observation by hundreds of scientists."
 traveler.8.a:0 "Continue observing the object."
 traveler.8.b:0 "Send our priests in place of scientists."
 traveler.8.c:0 "Dedicate our scientists to this project."

 traveler.9.name:0 "The Traveler"
 traveler.9.desc:0 "Upon arriving in [Root.GetStarName], [Root.GetName] initial scans revealed a signifigant anomaly. Closer inspection showed that this anomaly matches the description of the object described in recent rumors. [Root.GetName] immediately sent a report back to the Capital.\n\nThe report describes the sphere as appearing neither mechanical, nor organic in nature, while also apparently moving with intelligence. While no radio signals were detected, an unknown energy which matches that of a previously observed extragalactic event seems to radiate from the object. The environment of a planet the object was seen orbiting appeared to be undergoing terraformation. However, no apparent interaction was observed between the object and the planet. A footnote included in the report by [Root.GetLeaderName] requests that the object officialy be called "The Traveler.""

 traveler.13.name:0 "Traveler Uplifting"
 traveler.13.desc:0 "A previously primitive species has broadcast a message announcing their arrival to the galactic stage. Initially our scientists are baffled by how such a primitive society has become so technologically advanced in such a short time. However, the message a detailed recent history of their rise into space. The new empire claims that the Traveler, which has been spotted in their home system, granted them the knowledge needed to achieve space travel. This new information only deepens the mystery of The Traveler."
